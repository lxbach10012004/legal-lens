49603687,"Plaintiff Victor ChacÃ³n has filed a lawsuit against DEFENDANT, alleging the company violated Illinois law by collecting biometric information from employees without proper consent. The lawsuit claims that the company failed to inform employees in writing that their biometric information would be collected and stored, and did not provide a signed release or publish a retention schedule, as required by the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The lawsuit argues that if this biometric information were stolen, the employees could have their identities stolen, as biometric information cannot be changed. The plaintiff, a former employee of the defendant in 2018 and 2019, is seeking $5,000 in damages for each employee, or $1,000 per infraction if the court finds the violation was not willful.

DEFENDANT began using AI for orders in 2014 and switched to ConverseNow in 2020, which can process an unlimited number of orders simultaneously. A separate 2022 class action lawsuit accused DEFENDANT of unlawfully deducting tip credit from delivery drivers' wages and not adequately reimbursing them for delivery-related expenses. The plaintiff is represented by Kahn Swick and Foti LLC, and Don Bivens PLLC.","It's peculiar that my orders from DEFENDANT seemed to have been processed quickly since 2020, and I never had issues even during rush hours.
